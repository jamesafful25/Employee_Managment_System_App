⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/jamesafful25/Employee_Managment_System_App.git
cd Employee_Managment_System_App

🔧 Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install

Environment Variables (.env)

Create a .env file in the backend folder:

PORT=5000
DB_NAME=employee_management_system
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

Run Backend
npm run dev


Backend runs on:

http://localhost:5000

🎨 Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Frontend runs on:
http://localhost:5173

🔐 Authentication Flow
User logs in
Backend validates credentials
JWT token is generated
Token is stored (cookie or localStorage)
Protected routes require authentication middleware


 API Architecture
Controllers handle business logic
Routes define endpoints
Middlewares protect routes
Validators ensure clean input
Utils handle reusable logic
This follows clean and scalable backend architecture
